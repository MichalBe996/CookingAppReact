# CookingAppReact

This is cooking recipes app made in React, using login and register forms, that allow user to add their own recipes to the app. It is the largest project I've been developing
so far. Registration form uses self-made hooks. The logic behind logging in and adding recipes is yet to be implemented, but I'm planning on using firebase as database, that will 
potentially store registered users and recipes, just for reference I used seperate file that is list of objects which are recipes.
